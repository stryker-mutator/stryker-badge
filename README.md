# The app for the Stryker mutation score badge

## Work in progress!

This repository represents a work in progress.

A Node.js application that

- [X] Authenticates GitHub users using OAuth2.
- [ ] requests a list of projects from the authenticated user and shows it.
- [ ] saves projects for which a badge has to be displayed.
- [ ] generates a key for each project and shows it to the user.
Ideally, the key will not be stored in plain text in the database.
- [ ] accepts mutation score per user / repo.
The coverage data should uploaded using the above key.
If the correct key is used, store mutation score in database.
- [ ] retrieves the most recent score for a given user / repo, returned as a Shields.IO badge.
- [ ] some kind of database to store projects, keys and scores.
Let's start with PostgreSQL and see how things go.
- [ ] a nice front end app (written in Angular 5 and Bootstrap 4) for selecting projects, re-generating keys and stuff.

Other points
- [X] Should also works with lerna-style monorepos (with a sub-package name/label to identify the package).
- [ ] Make app generic so it could be used for other scores.

## Getting started

### Requirements
First things first, there's always something before you can start.

To make our life easier, we use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) a lot. Make sure you have it installed.

Our application runs in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you don't already use it, now would be the time. Make sure the Docker daemon is up and running.

We store our data in [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/services/storage/), so you need to be able to do so as well. On Windows, you can use the [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator). For Mac users, we recommend creating a free [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/services/storage/).

### GitHub OAuth application
[Register](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) a new OAuth application. This will allow users to connect to their GitHub account.

> Make sure you set the `Authorization callback URL` to `http://localhost:3000` (you can also use your preferred port).

### Build the application
Building the application is easy. First run `npm install && npm run build`, followed by: `docker build -t stryker/dashboard .`.

> If you run into problems with building using npm, this is likely caused by our use of `lerna` combined with some of the latest `node` features. A solution is to only use the npm install and build command in the `packages/website-frontend` directory.

### Configuration
Next, you need to define the following environment variables in a Docker [enviroment variables file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e-env-env-file):

> You can also enter these in the commandline, but we recommend using a separate file because it contains sensitive information.

Variable | Example | Explanation | Required
-------- | ------- | ----------- | --------
`AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`|`DefaultEndpointsProtocol...`|Azure-issued String to connect to your Azure Storage.|[X]
`GH_BASIC_CLIENT_ID`|`1234567890abcdef1234`|GitHub-issued Client ID.|[X]
`GH_BASIC_SECRET_ID`|`1234567890...abcdef1`|GitHub-issued Client Secret.|[X]
`JWT_SECRET`|`u7apm8MrMBe8Fwrx4uMH`|The secret for the HMAC algorithm that creates the signature of the [JWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).|[X]
`NODE_ENV`|`development`|Node setting for production environment. Used by us for some SSL settings. Can be either: `production` (default) or `development`.|[]
`PORT`|`3000`|Port on which Stryker Dashboard will listen for connections.|[]

### Start the application
To start the application, you can now simply run `docker run --env-file env.list -p 3000:3000 stryker/dashboard`. This will spin-up a Docker container with the image that was build earlier; provide it with your environment variables set in the `env-list` file; and open port 3000 so you can access it on your local machine.

Stryker Dashboard should now be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
